                    <p>Even if the patient is already loyal to you, you can still add value on his patronage by using his loyalty to improve your practice: the surveys will tell you what can be improved; the ratings and reviews will assist in attracting new customers, as well as making their decision easy, based on experience of previous visitors; the additional information from your newsletter will give your patients the ideas about the new options and treatments you can provide.</p>
